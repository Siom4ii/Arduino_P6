SMART TRASH BIN – COMPLETE MANUAL
1. COMPONENTS LIST
Electronics:
- Arduino Uno/Nano
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors (Front and Top)
- SG90/MG90S Servo Motor
- I2C LCD 16x2
- Passive Buzzer
- LEDs: Lid status + Level indication (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Resistors 220Ω
- Breadboard, wires, USB cable
Mechanical:
- Small trash bin with lid
- Servo mount, glue/screws, brackets
2. SYSTEM WIRING
Ultrasonic Front:
- VCC → 5V, GND → GND, TRIG → D8, ECHO → D7
Ultrasonic Top:
- VCC → 5V, GND → GND, TRIG → D4, ECHO → D3
Servo:
- Red → 5V, Brown → GND, Orange → D9
LCD I2C:
- VCC → 5V, GND → GND, SDA → A4, SCL → A5
Buzzer:
- + → D6, – → GND
LEDs:
- Lid LED → D10 (via 220Ω)
- Green LED → D11 (via 220Ω)
- Yellow LED → D12 (via 220Ω)
- Red LED → D13 (via 220Ω)
3. SYSTEM OPERATION
- Front sensor detects hand, requiring hold time before opening lid.
- Top sensor measures fill level.
- Lid servo opens and auto closes after timer.
- LEDs indicate level status.
- Buzzer alerts at 100% full.
- LCD displays real-time information.
4. SOFTWARE LOGIC
- Hand must stay detected for HAND_REQUIRED_TIME.
- Lid will not open when bin is full.
- Buzzer beeps in pattern when full.
- Fill percentage calculated from BIN_HEIGHT_CM.
- Non-blocking timers ensure smooth operation.
5. SAFETY & MAINTENANCE
- Do not force servo manually.
- Keep ultrasonic sensors clean.
- Recheck wiring periodically.
- Ensure stable 5V supply.
- Use cable ties to avoid wire tangling.
6. TESTING CHECKLIST
- Hand detection distance test
- Lid opening/closing test
- Fill-level percentage test
- LED function test
- Buzzer full-level alert test
- LCD visibility and clarity check
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
- LCD blank → try address 0x27 or 0x3F
- Servo jitter → use external 5V supply
- Wrong readings → clean sensors
- Buzzer quiet → ensure passive buzzer
