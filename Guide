🧠 3. SYSTEM WORKFLOW


Front ultrasonic sensor detects your hand
→ Lid opens
→ Timer starts
→ After 3 seconds (no hand) → lid closes


Top ultrasonic sensor measures bin depth
→ Calculates percentage fill
→ Displays on LCD


If fillPercent >= 100%
→ Plays Super Mario Theme once
→ LCD shows status
→ Lid still works normally



📺 4. LCD DISPLAY OUTPUT
Line 1:
Level: 48%
Line 2:
Lid: OPEN
or
Lid: CLOSED

🎶 5. AUDIO ALERTS


Bin Full → Super Mario Theme plays once


Sound will not repeat until bin becomes less than 100% full


Uses PASSIVE buzzer (tone-capable)


If your buzzer is quiet:
→ You may have ACTIVE buzzer (only beeps, no tones).

🛠️ 6. INSTALLATION STEPS
Step 1 – Mount the servo


Attach servo to bin so it can rotate the lid


Adjust angles inside code (LID_OPEN_ANGLE, LID_CLOSED_ANGLE)


Step 2 – Mount top ultrasonic


Install inside the lid


Facing downward


Measure BIN_HEIGHT_CM (top → bottom)


Step 3 – Mount front ultrasonic


Attach outside the bin


Pointing forward


Height where hand is usually placed


Step 4 – Install LCD


Put on front panel of bin


Secure with screws/glue


Step 5 – Connect wires to breadboard


Follow wiring table


Double-check GND connections



▶️ 7. UPLOADING THE CODE


Open Arduino IDE


Install library:


LiquidCrystal_I2C




Select board:


Tools → Board → Arduino Uno




Select port


Paste the combined full code I sent earlier


Upload



🧪 8. TESTING PROCEDURE
Lid Test


Put your hand 10–20 cm in front


Lid should open


Remove hand → closes after 3 seconds


Fill Level Test


Place objects inside bin


LCD % should increase


Mario Sound Test


Fill until sensor detects <5cm


Mario theme should play ONCE


Remove trash → sound resets



❗ 9. TROUBLESHOOTING
Buzzer very quiet


You might be using an active buzzer


Solution: replace with passive buzzer


Or I can give you "active buzzer" version (beep only)


LCD blank
Try:
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x3F, 16, 2);

Servo twitches


Use separate 5V power supply for servo


Connect grounds together


Level reading always 100%


Incorrect BIN_HEIGHT_CM


Sensor too close to lid


Obstructions inside bin


Mario song stops other functions


Song uses delay


Use "non-blocking music player" if needed
(ask me if you want this upgrade)



📘 10. MAINTENANCE


Keep ultrasonic sensors clean (dust affects readings)


Tighten servo mount screws


Keep wires away from hinge


Replace weak power supplies



If you want, I can generate a PDF version of this manual, or add images of exact wiring based on your parts.
Just tell me: "Make it PDF" or "Make wiring diagrams".
