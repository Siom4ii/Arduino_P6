🛠️ 5. Step-by-Step Build Manual
Step 1 — Mount the Lid Servo

Attach the servo near the hinge

Use a servo horn to push/lift the lid

Test angles using simple servo sweep code first

Tighten screws so the servo does not wobble

Step 2 — Install the Top Ultrasonic Sensor

Mount inside the lid

Must face straight down

Measure distance from sensor to bin floor → update BIN_HEIGHT_CM

Step 3 — Install the Front Ultrasonic Sensor

Mount on the bin front

Height: around your hand level

Angle: facing outward, not downward

Step 4 — Mount LCD

Use screws or glue

Orient so text is readable at standing height

Step 5 — Install LEDs

Drill small holes for LEDs

Or mount them on the lid panel

Ensure resistors are in series

Step 6 — Install Buzzer

Mount near a ventilation hole

Must not be blocked to keep sound loud

Step 7 — Wire Everything

Follow the wiring table & diagrams

Keep ground wires common

Zip-tie wires to avoid tangling

Step 8 — Upload Code

Paste the full code you already have

Install LiquidCrystal_I2C library

Set correct LCD address (0x27 or 0x3F)

🧪 6. Testing Checklist
✔ Sensor Testing

Move hand in front → distance should decrease

Add object inside bin → top sensor should measure correctly

✔ Servo Testing

Hand must stay for required time (800ms default)

Servo opens smoothly

Closes after 3 seconds

✔ Level Detection

Add trash gradually

Check LCD percentage updates correctly

✔ Buzzer Test

Simulate full bin by covering top sensor

Buzzer should beep repeatedly

✔ LED Tests

Green LED (<80%)

Yellow LED (80–99%)

Red LED (100%)

Lid LED on only when lid is open

📟 7. LCD Interface Guide

Normal Mode

Level: 45%
Lid: CLOSED


Hand detected & opening

Level: 45%
Lid: OPEN


Full bin (100%)

Level:100%
Lid: CLOSED


Add-ons available:

“FULL – CAN’T OPEN”

Blinking warning message

Large digits

⚠️ 8. Safety / Design Tips

Never force the servo by hand → gears break

Keep ultrasonic sensors clean

Do not put heavy trash directly on top sensor

Keep wires away from servo arm

Use external 5V supply if servo draws too much power

Add rubber feet to reduce vibration

🧼 9. Maintenance Tips

Clean ultrasonic sensor holes weekly

Recalibrate BIN_HEIGHT_CM if bin layout changes

Tighten servo mounts monthly

Check for loose jumper wires

Keep LCD covered from dust
