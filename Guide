ULTRASONIC MOTION TRACKER – FULL GUIDE / MANUAL
1️⃣ What This Project Does

This project uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and an Arduino UNO to measure:

Distance

Speed (velocity)

Acceleration

It works by sending out sound waves and timing the echo.

2️⃣ Parts You Need

Arduino UNO

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

Jumper wires

USB cable

Breadboard (optional)

Object to track (toy car, block, your hand, etc.)

3️⃣ Wiring Guide
Connect the ultrasonic sensor like this:
HC-SR04 Pin	Arduino Pin
VCC	5V
GND	GND
TRIG	Digital Pin 9
ECHO	Digital Pin 10

Make sure:

VCC is NOT on 3.3V

GND is firmly connected

5️⃣ How to Run It

Connect Arduino to your laptop

Open Arduino IDE

Select:

Tools → Board → Arduino UNO

Tools → Port → (your COM port)

Click Upload

Open Serial Monitor

Set baud rate: 9600

You should now see distance values updating.

6️⃣ Testing the Motion Tracker

Move an object toward or away from the sensor:

If the distance decreases → velocity is negative

If the distance increases → velocity is positive

If speed changes → acceleration is non-zero

Try rolling a car, sliding a block, or dropping an object (not too close).

7️⃣ How to Mount the Sensor

To get stable readings:

Place the sensor at the end of a table or track

Make sure there is nothing near the sides

Object should move straight toward or away from the sensor

Ideal distance range: 5 cm to 150 cm

8️⃣ Safety & Tips

Do not point the sensor at fabric or fuzzy surfaces → bad reflections

Hard surfaces (wood, plastic, cardboard, a cup, etc.) reflect best

Do not place objects closer than 3–5 cm → sensor becomes inaccurate

Keep wires tight and avoid shaking the board

9️⃣ Common Problems + Fixes
🔴 Problem: Always showing 0 or huge numbers

Fix: ECHO wire or TRIG wire is loose.

🔴 Problem: Numbers jump a lot

Fix:

Aim sensor directly at the object

Use a bigger flat surface as the reflector (cardboard piece)

Keep object centered

🔴 Problem: No output on Serial Monitor

Fix:

Set baud to 9600

COM port might be wrong
